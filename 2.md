## Defining the Discipline

**Software Engineering :**

1. The application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software; that is, the application of engineering to software.
2. The study of approaches as in (1)

**软件工程：**

1. 应用系统的、规范的、可量化的方法来开发、运行和维护软件；即工程在软件上的应用
2. 研究(1)中的方法

## The Software Process

A process is a collection of **activities**, **actions**, and **tasks** that are performed when some work product is to be created.

> ==coding(activity or stage)==
>
> - **action1**: check detailed design specification
>   - tasks …
> - **action2**: interface definition
>   - tasks … (对外接口，对内接口)
> - **action3**: code
>   - tasks …
> - **action4**: code review（评审）
>   - tasks …

### The Process Framework

**A process framework establishes the foundation for a complete software engineering process** by identifying a small number of framework activities that are applicable to all software projects, regardless of their size or complexity. In addition, the process framework encompasses a set of umbrella activities that are applicable across the entire software process. **A generic process framework for software engineering encompasses five activities:**

- Communication.
- Planning(umbrella activities).
- Modeling.
- Construction.
- Deployment.

These five generic framework activities can be used for different project or system development. **The details of the software process will be quite different in each case, but the framework activities remain the same.**

**流程框架通过识别适用于所有软件项目（无论其规模或复杂性）的少量框架活动，为完整的软件工程流程奠定了基础。**此外，流程框架包含一组适用于整个软件流程的伞式活动。 **软件工程的通用流程框架包含五项活动：**

- 沟通。
- 规划（伞式活动）。
- 建模。
- 建造。
- 部署。

这五个通用框架活动可用于不同的项目或系统开发。 **每种情况下软件流程的细节都会有很大不同，但框架活动保持不变。**
